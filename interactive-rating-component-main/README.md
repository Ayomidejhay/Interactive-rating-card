## Overview


The challenge is an interactive rating card, where I had to put my HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge to use.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
